\section{Challenges}

The ATTiny85 is extremely limited on General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins. The entire chip only has 8 pins; after reset, power, and ground the user is left with only five pins to work with. 1
There are concerns of networks splitting and forming two separately synced networks, even more so in hardware where the watchdog is an imprecise timer.
