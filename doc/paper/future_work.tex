Due to the short time period given on this project, the greatest limiting factor was time. The system merits much deeper investigation, and there is plenty to explore.

Despite multiple forms of error checking, bad data still arrived and propagated through the network quite quickly. LQI this does lend itself to interesting potential applications. RSSI and LQI numbers are subject to interference from Wi-Fi router, cell phones, microwaves, and other sources of 2.4 GHz interference.

The system's sleep current consumption was significantly higher than planned. Though the wake/sleep duty cycle chosen was not significantly impacted by our limitations. As the duty cycle decreases and the system spends more time in sleep, the need to achieve the proposed power consumption are more critical. With a 1 second wakeup every 10 minutes the system lasts a little over 9 days with our current power consumption, but over 2 years if had the system hit the ideal consumption numbers.
