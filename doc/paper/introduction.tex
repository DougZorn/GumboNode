\section{Introduction}

Wireless sensor nodes consist of low-cost microcontrollers with a few sensors attached. Their low cost, small size, and low power consumption make them extremely attractive for deployment over large areas or areas inaccessible to humans. However, this benefit precludes the ability to repair or maintain a specific individual node. As such, nodes need to be as cheap and power efficient as possible.
