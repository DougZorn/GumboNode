\begin{abstract}
Ad-hoc wireless sensor networks are predicted to increase in use significantly as advances in their core
hardware components continue.  They have already attracted considerable interest in academia and have
been successfully deployed for a variety of applications.  Despite advances in this area, cost and power
limitations remain the major obstacles to their use.

In this paper we would like to explore the general problem of transferring data around a network
at minimal cost.  We present several protocols to transfer data across an ad-hoc network while
preserving the data's locality.  We will explore the problem of exchanging throughput for power
savings and will demonstrate what is possible in terms of through-put and power use with hardware
currently available on the market.  With this we hope to demonstrate the cost trade-offs associated
with wireless ad-hoc networks today how throughput can be sacrificed for power savings.

%Wireless sensor networks are predicted to increase in use significantly as advances in their core
%hardware components continue.  There are already many distributed, wireless sensor networks in use for
%a variety of applications, including wildlife conservation, security, and general purpose data-transfer
%networks.  Despite advances in the private sector and the research community in these areas, the
%primary limiting factor for such networks remain: cost and power consumption.

%In this paper, we would like to explore the general problem of transferring data around a network
%while preserving both the information and its locality.  Cost remains an issue in such network, as
%even a small cost is multiplied among many nodes.  Though memory has gotten increasingly cheap, there
%remain cut-offs between different models of chips, and even a few KBs of memory can make a significant
%difference in the project's budget.  We propose a several bare-bones protocols for synchronizing data,
%which can achieve reasonable through-put rates using a minimum of power and instruction memory.  We
%will demonstrate the through-put rates achievable with our system and relate them to cost, based on
%hardware currently available.

%In this paper we would like to explore low-power wireless sensor networks.  Sensor networks are predicted
%to increase in use significantly as advances in their core hardware components continue.

%We have developed an extremely low-cost wireless sensor node, and have maximized its life by implementing a variety of power-conservation techniques. We introduce a localization system using received signal strength indicators provided when the wireless transceiver receives a packet to account for variations in measurements due to distance. We first demonstrate our system in  ContikiOS. Next we construct twenty of these nodes using off-the-shelf hardware on an extremely limited budget.  Finally, we also construct a gateway to enable communication between simulated nodes and hardware.
